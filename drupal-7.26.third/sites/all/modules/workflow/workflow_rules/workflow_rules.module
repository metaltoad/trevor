 * all prefer a lower code footprint and better performance.
 * Additional credit to gcassie ( http://drupal.org/user/80260 ) for
 * the initial push to split rules out of core workflow.
 *
 * This file is intentionally left blanc.
 * The code is in the workflow_rules.workflow.inc file.
 * Drupal 7 requires a .module file, even if it is empty.
